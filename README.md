# ðŸ§® Maths Projects

A collection of my mathematics projects spanning from high school through university.  
This repository serves as a portfolio of problem-solving, coding, and theoretical exploration in areas ranging from pure maths to applied modelling.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The repository is organised chronologically and thematically:

- `highschool/` â€“ Early projects, competition problems, and coursework.  
- `university/` â€“ Coursework, assignments, and research explorations.  
- `personal/` â€“ Independent projects, experiments, and applied mathematics.  

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with project-specific details.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

Some featured projects include:

- **Algebraic Modelling** â€“ Polynomial fitting, solving Diophantine equations, and symmetry explorations.  
- **Calculus & Analysis** â€“ Maclaurin/Taylor expansions, series convergence, optimisation.  
- **Probability & Statistics** â€“ Bayesian inference, random processes, option pricing methods.  
- **Applied Mathematics** â€“ Mechanics problems, optimisation in finance, machine learning with mathematical underpinnings.  

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Languages

- **MATLAB** â€“ Numerical computing and simulations.  
- **Python** â€“ Data science, symbolic maths (`sympy`, `numpy`, `pandas`).  
- **C** â€“ Programming fundamentals and mathematical algorithms.  
- **LaTeX / Markdown** â€“ Documentation, notes, and proofs.

## ðŸ“œ Purpose

This repository is both:

1. A **record of learning** â€“ showing how my mathematical thinking has evolved over time.  
2. A **reference toolkit** â€“ containing useful methods, scripts, and solved problems.  

It is not meant to be a polished library, but rather a working collection of ideas and solutions.

## ðŸ“– Usage

Clone the repo and explore by folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
